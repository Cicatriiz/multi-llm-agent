"""AB-MCTS (Adaptive Branching Monte Carlo Tree Search) implementation for multi-LLM agents.

This module implements both AB-MCTS-A (with node aggregation) and AB-MCTS-M (with mixed models)
algorithms for intelligent multi-LLM agent selection and execution.

Includes enhanced implementations with full PyMC integration for hierarchical Bayesian modeling.
